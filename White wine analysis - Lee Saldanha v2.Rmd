wines$X <- NULL  # dropping the X/ID variable as it's irrelevant for the analysis

# Upon noticing there was a differentiation in the types of sulfur dioxide, decided to create a derived "bound sulfur dioxide" variable for exploration
wines$bound.sulfur.dioxide <- wines$total.sulfur.dioxide -
  wines$free.sulfur.dioxide
```

Let's plot histograms for all variables in order to take a general look at the white wines dataset.

# Univariate Plots Section
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
# Plotting histograms for all variables to take a general look at the dataset

ggplot(aes(x = quality), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = citric.acid), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram()
```

***residual.sugar*** shows a high peak close to 0, so let's apply a log10 transformation for a better look at what is happening.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram() + scale_x_log10()
```

With the new scale now ***residual.sugar*** shows a bimodal distribution, which might be helpful for the analysis later.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Continuing the above plotting of histograms

ggplot(aes(x = chlorides), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.005)

ggplot(aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)

ggplot(aes(x = bound.sulfur.dioxide), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)

ggplot(aes(x = total.sulfur.dioxide), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)

ggplot(aes(x = density), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.001)

ggplot(aes(x = pH), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = sulphates), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = alcohol), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)
```

***alcohol*** shows a somewhat linear distribution, different from the previous variables.

# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?

The white wines dataset has 4,898 records and 12 columns/variables originally (excluding the X/ID variable). All the feature variables (thus also excluding quality) have continuous values.

As seen in the above histograms, for most variables, data is rather normally distributed (with or without long tails); ***alcohol*** and ***residual.sugar*** are the most evident exceptions.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# A look at the dataset structure and the summary of variables values

str(wines)
summary(wines)
```

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

The ***quality*** feature is the output variable, in this dataset ranging from a score of 3 to 9. I am no expert myself, but as someone who appreciates wine I am led to think that the main characteristics that make up a good quality wine are acidity and sugar, which will then be the first variables I will analyze.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

Appearing as two related measures (free and total), I believe sulfur dioxide must have a more direct influence in the quality of wine, probably along with sulphates and the pH.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?
I created the ***bound.sulfur.dioxide*** variable based on the ***total.sulfur.dioxide*** amount minus the portion indicated as ***free.sulfur.dioxide***.

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?

I noticed an unusual distribution of the ***residual.sugar*** variable. It peaks at  values close to 0, so I decided to analyze it using a log10 transformation. With the new scale, it showed a bimodal distribution.

The ***alcohol*** variable also has a unique distribution compared to the other ones, as it appears to be more linear (decreasing).

In many cases, I changed the binwidth in the charts for a better view. Some distributions were found to have long tails as well.

# Bivariate Plots Section
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}
# Loading the GGally package for running some correlation analysis
library(GGally)

# Converting quality to factor should help with the analysis of ggpairs charts
wines$quality <- as.factor(wines$quality)

ggpairs(wines, columnLabels = c("fxd ac", "vlat ac", "citr ac",
                                "sugar", "chlord", "free SO2", "tot SO2",
                                "dnsty", "pH", "sulph", "alcoh",
                                "qual", "bnd SO2"))

```

Let's also run the ggcorr function for a clearer look at the correlations.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Converting quality back to numeric to be able to calculate correlation coefficients
wines$quality <- as.numeric(levels(wines$quality))[wines$quality]
# Transparent labels with 2 decimals
ggcorr(wines, label = TRUE, label_alpha = TRUE, label_round = 2)

```

Now let's take a closer look at the boxplots for ***quality***, since they display too small in the ggpairs matrix output.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots2}
# Converting quality back to factor for boxplots
wines$quality <- as.factor(wines$quality)

# Now plotting all variables against quality as boxplots 
ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = fixed.acidity), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(4,10))

ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = volatile.acidity), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,0.9))

ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = citric.acid), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,0.8))

ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = residual.sugar), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = chlorides), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = free.sulfur.dioxide), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = total.sulfur.dioxide), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

For some boxplots we can see that there are fewer outliers and narrower interquartile ranges as ***quality*** increases, for example in the above boxplot of ***total.sulfur.dioxide***.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = bound.sulfur.dioxide), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = density), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.985, 1.005), breaks = seq(0.99,1,0.002))

ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = pH), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = sulphates), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = alcohol), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Actually many of the above bloxplots show narrower interquartile ranges as ***quality*** increases. This will be discussed in more detail in the following section.

# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?

A very interesting observation extracted from the above boxplots is that for several variables the interquartile range for wines of quality 9 is generally much narrower than those of lower quality wines. This is particularly true for variables ***residual.sugar***, ***total.sulfur.dioxide***, ***density***, ***sulphates*** and ***alcohol***.

Even considering there are just 5 wines of quality 9 in this dataset, such narrow value ranges could suggest these variables are some kind of "baseline" value for a wine to be considered of higher quality. Considering that these input variables are measured by physicochemical tests while the output variable ***quality*** is scored based on sensory evaluation, it is really interesting to note that experts seem to be able to rate the quality of a wine based on very specific characteristics only by using their senses.

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

By looking at the boxplots and the correlation matrix, an inverse/negative relationship can be observed between the quality of wine and its ***density***...

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Just plotting the density x quality boxplot again as a segway to the next 2 plots
ggplot(aes(x = quality, y = density), data = wines) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.985, 1.005), breaks = seq(0.99,1,0.002))
```

... which in turn has a stronger and more linear correlation with ***alcohol*** and ***residual.sugar***, as can be seen in the two charts below.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Plotting the density x sugar scatterplot, two tightly correlated variables
ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar, y = density), data = wines) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/20) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.985, 1.005))

# Plotting the density x alcohol scatterplot, correlated variables as well
ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, y = density), data = wines) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/20) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.985, 1.005))
```

### What was the strongest relationship you found?

Several variables seem to have a strong relationship with the quality of wine, as discussed above for the boxplots and the narrow interquartile ranges. The two that show the strongest relationships so far are ***alcohol*** and ***density***; however, from the boxplots we can also note that ***chlorides*** and ***total.sulfur.dioxide*** seem to have a rather linear relationship with quality as well.

# Multivariate Plots Section

Let's first take a look at the histograms for the variables we found to have narrow interquartile ranges for wines of quality 9, and color them according to ***quality***.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots}
# Re-plotting some histograms, now colored by the quality variable for more detail
ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = quality)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(3,11))

ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = quality)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,0.7))

ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = quality)) +
  scale_x_log10()

ggplot(aes(x = chlorides), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = quality), binwidth = 0.002) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,0.1))
```

Some relationship can be seen in the above chart between fewer chlorides and superior quality.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = total.sulfur.dioxide), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = quality), binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,300), breaks=seq(0,300,25))
```

Some relationship can be seen in the above chart between less sulfur dioxide and superior quality.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = density), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = quality), binwidth = 0.001) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0.985,1.005), breaks = seq(0.99,1,0.002))
```

Some relationship can be seen in the above chart between less density and superior quality.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = sulphates), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = quality))

ggplot(aes(x = alcohol), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = quality), binwidth = 0.2)
```

Still not very visually clear through these histograms only, but some trends can be seen, for example, with higher quality wines being found most commonly at lower density levels and higher alcohol values.

Now let's look at multivariate scatterplots colored by ***quality***.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading the ColorBrewer package for more flexible chart colors
library(RColorBrewer)

# Re-plotting the 2 scatterplots and adding 1 more, all now colored by quality
ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar, y = density, color = quality), data = wines) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/2, size = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 16,
                     guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(
                       alpha = 1, size = 3))) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.985,1.005), breaks = seq(0.99,1,0.002)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,30))
```

Here we can continue to see the relationship between ***density*** and ***quality***, with superior quality wines (darker blue dots) being more present at lower density values in the y-axis.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, y = density, color = quality), data = wines) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 2/5, size = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 16,
                     guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(
                       alpha = 1, size = 3))) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.985,1.005), breaks = seq(0.99,1,0.002))

ggplot(aes(x = alcohol, y = residual.sugar, color = quality), data = wines) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/2, size = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 16,
                     guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(
                       alpha = 1, size = 3))) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,30))
```

Having analyzed these variables, let's now create a model. We will iteratively add variables to the model to see which variables contribute more to a higher R^2^ value.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading the utility memisc package
library(memisc)

# Converting back to numeric to be able to use quality in the model/function
wines$quality <- as.numeric(levels(wines$quality))[wines$quality]

# Iteratively adding variables to the model
m1 <- lm(quality ~ fixed.acidity + residual.sugar, data = wines)
m2 <- update(m1, ~ . + alcohol)
m3 <- update(m2, ~ . + density)
m4 <- update(m3, ~ . + volatile.acidity)
m5 <- update(m4, ~ . + pH)
m6 <- update(m5, ~ . + sulphates)
m7 <- update(m6, ~ . + free.sulfur.dioxide)

# Now comparing the various iterations to see which variables contribute more to R^2
mtable(m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7)
```

# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?

In the histograms colored by quality, trends can be seen with higher quality wines having ***volatile.acidity*** values lower than 0.3, ***chlorides*** values between 0.025 and 0.05, ***total.sulfur.dioxide*** values between 90 and 160, ***density*** values between 0.99 and 0.995, and ***alcohol*** values greater than 10.5, as initially indicated by the quality boxplots.

In the scatterplots, the relationship between some variables (other than ***quality***) becomes clearer. In the first scatterplot, it is visible that higher quality wines are more commonly found at lower values of ***residual.sugar*** (less than 10) and also lower ***density*** (less than 0.994). The second scatterplot follows the same logic as the previous one, with the darker blue dots (higher quality wines) being more commonly found for ***density*** values of 0.994 and lower, and for ***alcohol*** values of 11 and above. The last scatterplot is a combination of the previous ones, where most higher quality wines can be found for lower values of ***residual.sugar*** and higher values of ***alcohol***.

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

The relationship between more volume of alcohol and less density is personally a surprising finding, despite being already described in the [White Wine Quality information document](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt).

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the strengths and limitations of your model.

A linear model was created using several variables, which were added iteratively to check the effect that each had on the results. The selected variables account for only 28.2% of the variance in the quality of wines. The ones that contribute most to this value of R^2^ are ***alcohol*** and ***volatile.acidity***, which alone account for an R^2^ = 0.24.

This model using 8 variables and having an R^2^ value of only 0.282 is very limited, but this appears to be due to the nature of the dataset. The quality score is based on the sensory evaluation of 3 wine experts and, as explained in the [White Wine Quality information document](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt), support vector machine is the model that achieves the best results according to the dataset authors. As we proceed to Project 4 and learn about machine learning, it could be interesting to test a support vector machine model with this white wines dataset and see how it improves the results.

# Final Plots and Summary

### Plot 1 - Histogram of wines by quality
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}
# Converting back to factor
wines$quality <- as.factor(wines$quality)

# Plotting a simple quality histogram
ggplot(aes(x = quality), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram() +
  ylab("count of wines") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of wines by quality")
```

### Description

The distribution of wines by quality is rather normal, with the vast majority being of quality 5 to 7.

### Plot 2 - Histogram of wines by alcohol and quality
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Two}
# Plotting an alcohol histogram colored by wine quality
ggplot(aes(x = alcohol), data = wines) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = quality), binwidth = 0.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(8,14,0.5)) +
  xlab("alcohol (%)") +
  ylab("count of wines") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of wines by alcohol and quality")
```

### Description

This histogram provides a clear view of how alcohol is related to the quality of wines. Wines of quality 6 and above are found in clearly higher proportions for alcohol volumes of 9.5% and above.

### Plot 3 - Scatterplot of wine quality by residual sugar and density
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Plot_Three}
# Plotting a scatterplot of wine quality by residual sugar and density
# Using the expression(paste()) functions to be able to write superscripts
ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar, y = density, color = quality), data = wines) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/2, size = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq', palette = 16,
                     guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(
                       alpha = 1, size = 3))) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.985,1.005), breaks = seq(0.99,1,0.002)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,30)) +
  xlab(expression(paste("residual sugar (g/",dm^{3},")"))) +
  ylab(expression(paste("density (g/",cm^{3},")"))) +
  ggtitle("Scatterplot of wine quality by residual sugar and density")
```

### Description

This scatterplot shows that, for the same levels of residual sugar (x-axis constant), higher quality wines tend to have lower density. This can be seen as "stripes" in the scatterplot (variation in the y-axis holding the values in the x-axis constant), with the top of the curve being mostly composed by lighter blue dots (wine quality 6 or less) and the bottom of the curve being mostly darker blue (wine quality 7 or more). Another obvious conclusion from this scatterplot is that density increases as the residual sugar also increases.

# Reflection

With the first plotted histogram (count of wines by quality), it already became clear that this white wines dataset was not balanced and contained many more regular wines (of quality 5 to 7) than poor or excellent ones. Wines of quality 5 to 7 make up over 92.5% of the total and this unbalanced distribution could have an impact on the analysis conducted. Also, the dataset has 11 input variables, which right from the beginning made me wonder whether all of them would be relevant or not for the analysis. I noticed some variables are correlated or dependent on each other, for example, ***free.sulfur.dioxide*** and ***total.sulfur.dioxide***, and ***density***, ***residual.sugar*** and ***alcohol***. This is also mentioned in the [White Wine Quality information document](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt) and is one of the reasons why I tested most if not all of the variables when creating the linear model.

Before creating the model, some of the multivariate plots already gave a good indication of which variables have the strongest relation with ***quality***, most notably ***sulphates***, ***volatile.acidity*** and ***alcohol***. However, when creating a linear model to predict ***quality*** the best combination of variables tested could only lead to an R^2^ = 0.282. Linear models are known to be a very simple approach and thus provide only a limited solution to this specific problem. As explained in the [White Wine Quality information document](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt) as well, the authors have tested this dataset and found that the model that achieves the best results is support vector machine. As we proceed to Project 4 and learn about machine learning, it could be interesting to test a support vector machine model with this white wines dataset and see how it improves the results.
